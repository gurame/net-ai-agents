# Viewing Invoices

When you open InvoiceApp, you’ll land on the **Invoices** page. This page is your dashboard for everything related to your billing.

Each row in the invoice table shows:
- **Description** – a short name for the work or product
- **Amount** – how much the client owes you
- **Date** – when the invoice was created
- **Status** – Paid or Pending
- **Due** – the deadline for payment

## How to Use the Invoice List
- Scan the **Status** column to see which invoices need your attention.
- Use the **Due** date column to plan follow-ups with clients.
- Click **Submit New Invoice** to add another invoice.

## Example Use Cases
- Check all invoices due this week before following up with clients.
- Mark invoices as paid immediately after receiving bank confirmation.

## Gotchas
- The table is not sorted automatically — you may need to scroll to find older invoices.
- If you accidentally mark an invoice as paid, simply untick the box to set it back to pending.
